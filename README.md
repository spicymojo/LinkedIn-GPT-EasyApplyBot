# LinkedIn GPT
Automatically apply to _LinkedIn Easy Apply_ jobs. This bot answers the application questions as well!

This is a fork of a fork of the original _LinkedIn Easy Apply Bot_, but it is a very special fork of a fork, this one relies on LLMs to answer the questions.

> This is for educational purposes only. I am not responsible if your LinkedIn account gets suspended or for anything else.

This bot is written in Python using Selenium and OpenAI.

## Fork Notes
Forking this when the day comes, at some point, that we have time to actually make my own version of this

## Setup

### OpenAI API Key
First you need to provide your Open AI API key using environment variable `OPEN_AI_API_KEY`.

> [You can set up the environment variable in your venv](https://stackoverflow.com/a/20918496/8150874)

I recommend to set a [Rate Limit](https://platform.openai.com/account/rate-limits) on your OpenAI account if you plan to leave the bot running for a long time, as it can get expensive quickly. I tried to use the cheapest models possible, but still requires `GPT-3.5-Turbo` to work.

### Your information
Your information is provided with a directory containing the following files:
- `config.yaml`. This file contains the information used to search on LinkedIn and fill in your personal information. Most of this is self-explanatory but if you need explanations please see the end of this `README`.
- `plain_text_resume.md`. Will be used to answer the questions, it's provided in MarkDown format.
- `plain_text_cover_letter.md`. Will be used when the form ask for a cover letter. When the form ask to write a cover letter (not upload it), the bot will adjust the cover letter to the job description.
  - You can use placeholders in your cover letter, a placeholder is defined as `[[placeholder]]`, the LLM will look onto the job description to fill in the placeholders. E.g. `[[company]]` will be replaced by the given company name.
- `personal_data.md`. More information about you, what you want of the job search, work authorization, extended information not covered by the resume, etc. This will be used to answer the questions, and inform other parts of the application. This file doesn't have any structure, will be interpreted by the LLM so fell free to add structure or information as you see fit.
- `job-filters.md`. This file gives you more control over the jobs that the bot applies to. There are two sections: `# Job Title Filters` and `# Job Description Filters` , these must be included on the document, these names are hardcoded on the script __do not modify them__.
- `resume.pdf`. Will be uploaded to LinkedIn when applying. The resume file can have a different name as long as it is a pdf file and the name contains the word `resume`. E.g. `Michael_Scott_Resume.pdf`.
- `cover_letter.pdf`. Will be uploaded to LinkedIn when applying if provided and the job application asks for it. The cover letter file can have a different name as long as it is a pdf file and the name contains the word `cover`. E.g. `Dwight_Schrute_Cover_Letter.pdf`.

  The `# Job Title Filters` section is used to filter the job title, and the `# Job Description Filters` section is used to filter the job description (once the job passes the job title filtering). The information on these sections is used on different steps of the process, you can have different rules on each section, or the same rules on both sections.
  
  Use natural language to explain what you are interested in, and what you are not. The LLM will try to understand what you mean, and will decide to apply or not to the job. 

> An `output` folder will be created, where you will find all generated answers to the questions.

The folder approach enables you to have multiple configurations (based on locations, roles...), and switch between them easily.

**You will find templates for all this files in the `templates` folder.**

### Install required libraries

# Known issues
- The bot not always replaces correctly the placeholders on the cover letter.
- If any field has problems with the answer, e.g. expected a number and the bot generated a text, the application will not proceed.
- Usually the first screen asking for contact information also ask for a `summary`, gpt doesn't fill this screen, so the application will not proceed.
