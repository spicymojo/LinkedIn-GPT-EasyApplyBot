# LinkedIn Easy Apply Bot
Automatically apply to LinkedIn Easy Apply jobs. This bot answers the application questions as well!

This is a fork of a fork of the original _LinkedIn Easy Apply Bot_, but it is a very special fork of a fork, this one relies on GPT-3 to answer the questions. 



> This is for educational purposes only. I am not responsible if your LinkedIn account gets suspended or for anything else.

This bot is written in Python using Selenium and OpenAI API.

## Fork Notes

The original bot implementation, couldn't handle open questions, just used keywords and predefined answers. Such couldn't complete a lot of the applications, as any open question or weird selector would make the bot unable to answer.  Now that we have LLM, this is an easy problem to solve, just ask the bot to answer the question, and it will do it.

Another great benefit, is that you can provide way more information to the bot, so it can address truthfully the job requirements, and the questions, just as a human would do. 

I did try to tidy the code a bit, but I didn't want to spend too much time on it, as I just wanted to get it working, so there is still a lot of work to do there.

Thank you for everyone that contributed to the original bot, and all the forks, as made my work way easier.

### Future updates
- I will keep updating this fork as I use it for my own "educational research".
- I will add features as I find fun applications, or I require them for my "educational research".

## Setup

### OpenAI API Key
First you need to provide your Open AI API key using environment variable `OPEN_AI_API_KEY`.

> [You can set up the environment variable in your venv](https://stackoverflow.com/a/20918496/8150874)

I recommend to set a [Rate Limit](https://platform.openai.com/account/rate-limits) on your OpenAI account if you plan to leave the bot running for a long time, as it can get expensive quickly. I tried to use the cheapest models possible, but still requires `GPT-3.5-Turbo` to work.

### Your information
Your information is provided with a directory containing the following files:
- `config.yaml`. This file contains the information used to search on LinkedIn and fill in your personal information. Most of this is self-explanatory but if you need explanations please see the end of this `README`.
- `resume.pdf`. Will be uploaded to LinkedIn when applying.
- `cover_letter.pdf`. Will be uploaded to LinkedIn when applying if provided and the job application asks for it.
- `plain_text_resume.md`. Will be used to answer the questions, it's provided in MarkDown format.
- `plain_text_cover_letter.md`. Will be used when the form ask for a cover letter. When the form ask to write a cover letter (not upload it), the bot will adjust the cover letter to the job description.
  - You can use placeholders in your cover letter, a placeholder is defined as `[[placeholder]]`, the LLM will look onto the job description to fill in the placeholders. E.g. `[[company]]` will be replaced by the given company name.
- `personal_data.md`. More information about you, what you want of the job search, work authorization, extended information not covered by the resume, etc. This will be used to answer the questions, and inform other parts of the application. This file doesn't have any structure, will be interpreted by the LLM so fell free to add structure or information as you see fit.

> An `output` folder will be created, where you will find all generated answers to the questions.

The folder approach enables you to have multiple configurations (based on locations, roles...), and switch between them easily.

**You will find templates for all this files in the `templates` folder.**

### Install required libraries
> You should use a `virtual environment` for this, but it is not required.
```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Execute
To run the bot, run the following in the command line, providing the path to your personal information directory as only argument.
```bash

# Known issues
- The bot not always replaces correctly the placeholders on the cover letter.
- If any field has problems with the answer, e.g. expected a number and the bot generated a text, the application will not proceed.
- Usually the first screen asking for contact information also ask for a `summary`, gpt doesn't fill this screen, so the application will not proceed.
